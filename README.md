# Monthly Rainfall Analyzer

This repository contains a Python program designed to analyze monthly rainfall data. The program reads rainfall measurements from an input file, calculates total and average rainfall, and identifies the months with the highest and lowest rainfall amounts.

 Features

- Error Handling: Handles invalid data and missing files gracefully, providing warnings or error messages as needed.
- Statistical Analysis:
  - Calculates total yearly rainfall.
  - Computes average monthly rainfall.
  - Identifies months with the minimum and maximum rainfall.
- Results Display: Outputs the analysis results in a clear and structured format.

 File Structure

- AshEll_Program7.py: The main Python script containing the program logic.
- Program7.txt: Input file with monthly rainfall data.

 Usage

1. Ensure the input file Program7.txt is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the program using Python:
   bash
   python AshEll_Program7.py
   
3. View the rainfall statistics in the console output.

 Requirements
